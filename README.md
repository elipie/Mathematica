# Mathematica
Mathematica is an interpreted small language that is being worked on right now!
Mathematica is a language that focuses, well, on *math*. Right now it is just a test for a bigger, stronger language called Pie. Elipie thought it would be a good idea to make a test language so he can add content in the works for Pie! 

# Use it!

Right now, it only has these operators: `+, -, /, *, ==, !=, >, <`
